### Data Quality and Validation Framework

The Danish Energy Analytics Platform implements a comprehensive data quality framework designed to ensure that analytical outputs are based on accurate, complete, and consistent data. This framework recognizes that data quality issues are inevitable when working with real-world data sources and implements systematic approaches to detect, quantify, and address these issues.

Data completeness validation ensures that expected data points are received from each source according to their publication schedules. For real-time sources like Energinet's API, the platform expects data points every 5 minutes and generates alerts when data is missing for more than 15 minutes. For batch sources like monthly statistics, the platform monitors publication schedules and alerts when expected data is not received within reasonable timeframes.

The platform maintains comprehensive metadata about expected data patterns, including typical value ranges, seasonal patterns, and correlation relationships between different metrics. This metadata enables automated anomaly detection that can identify potentially erroneous data points before they impact analytical outputs. For example, the system can detect when reported wind power production is inconsistent with weather conditions or when electricity prices show unusual patterns that may indicate data transmission errors.

Data consistency validation ensures that related metrics maintain logical relationships. For instance, the platform validates that total electricity production equals total consumption plus net exports, accounting for transmission losses and storage changes. When inconsistencies are detected, the platform implements automated reconciliation procedures where possible and flags significant discrepancies for manual review.

Temporal consistency validation ensures that time-series data maintains appropriate continuity and does not contain impossible jumps or discontinuities. This is particularly important for cumulative metrics like total energy production, where sudden changes may indicate meter resets or data processing errors rather than actual system changes.

Cross-source validation compares data from multiple sources to identify potential quality issues. For example, renewable energy production data from Energinet can be cross-validated against capacity utilization data from the Danish Energy Agency to ensure consistency. When discrepancies are identified, the platform implements hierarchical data source preferences based on reliability and timeliness characteristics.

The data quality framework generates comprehensive quality scores for each data point and data source, enabling users to understand the reliability of analytical outputs.
